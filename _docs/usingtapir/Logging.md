<i>tapir</i> uses Log4j2 as logging framework.

# Configuration

<i>tapir</i> does not recommend any configuration style. You can configure
Log4j2 the way you prefer. Just take a look
at https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html.

Anyway, if you prefer using a xml file this one is a good starting
point. It is generated by our [archetype]({{"/docs/usingtapir/archetypes/" | prepend: site.baseurl}}) as well:

**log4j2.xml**

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="INFO">
    <Appenders>
        <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
            <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n" />
        </Console>
    </Appenders>
    <Loggers>
        <Root level="info">
            <AppenderRef ref="Console" />
        </Root>
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```

# What about third-party libraries?

<i>tapir</i> uses bridges to redirect the logging output of logging frameworks
which are used by third-party libraries to Log4j2. That has the
advantage that you can configure all loggers with a Log4j2
configuration.

We analyzed the logging frameworks which our third-party libraries used
and included the corresponding bridges in the tapir-depenencies module.
If you add additional frameworks with additional logging frameworks you
have to add the bridge by yourself.

The following logging frameworks are bridged out-of-the-box:

-   [Log4j 1.2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/)

    <div class="panel-heading">
