JUnit 5 is the successor of [JUnit 4]({{"/docs/execution/junit4/" | prepend: site.baseurl}}). In contrast to JUnit 4, the support for custom test engines is one of its core features. Moreover, JUnit 5 is designed with great IDE support in mind.

These characteristics fit perfectly for <i>tapir</i>.

## Dependency

``` xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.tapir-test</groupId>
  <artifactId>tapir-extensions-junit5-execution</artifactId>
  <version>{{site.latesttapirextensionsversion}}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Eclipse

You can start your <i>tapir</i> tests directly from Eclipse by right-clicking
the test class and selecting *Run As* | *JUnit Test*.

![]({{"/img/docs/46497836/46497856.png" | prepend: site.baseurl}}){:height="500px" width="600px"}

The progress and the results are displayed in the JUnit view.

![]({{"/img/docs/46497836/46497857.png" | prepend: site.baseurl}})


<div class="panel panel-info">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <div class="panel-title"><span class="fas fa-info-circle"></span> Hint</div>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
  You can select any method/step and execute it with <i>Run As</i> \| <i>JUnit
  Test</i>. The selected and all upcoming steps are executed.
  </div>
</div>
## Maven

As <i>tapir</i> fulfills the JUnit5 API, it integrates transparently with the maven-surefire-plugin/maven-failsafe-plugin.

You can execute the tests by running this command:

``` text
> mvn clean integration-test
```

## Jenkins

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) provides a [JUnit
plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit) which is 100% compatible with
<i>tapir</i>. The JUnit plugin consumes XML test reports (which are generated by
<i>tapir's</i> JUnit module) and provides some graphical visualization of the
historical test results as well as a web UI for viewing test reports,
tracking failures, and so on. 

In general all the frameworks and tools which are compatible to JUnit 5 are compatible to <i>tapir</i> as well.
