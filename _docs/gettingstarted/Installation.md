# IDE

We recommend to develop the Tapir test cases with Eclipse 4.6+. Eclipse
is usually shipped with a Maven integration plugin. If such an
integration is missing, you should install one, for instance M2Eclipse.
Also, many aspects of Tapir are realized by using the Xtend language and
its features. A Xtend plugin in the Version 2.12 is therefore required.
A suitable pluginfor Eclipse is provided by the Xtend team. Further IDEs
(for instance IntelliJ IDEA) might provide suitable plugins as well, but
are not explicitly supported.

# Build Systems

You install Tapir by including the required dependencies in your
project. A more detailed documentation for Maven and Gradle can be found
here. Tapir might work with further build tools and systems, but this is
not specifically supported.
