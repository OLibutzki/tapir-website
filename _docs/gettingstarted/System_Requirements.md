<i>tapir</i> requires <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java 8</a> or above.
Build support is provided and docuemnted for [Maven 3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/). [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) might work as well, but its usage is not documented and officially supported.
We recommend developing <i>tapir</i> test cases with the latest [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) and [Xtend 2.13](http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/).
Details on the installation of the IDE can be found in the following section.
