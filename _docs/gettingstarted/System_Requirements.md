<i>tapir</i> requires <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java 8</a> or above.
Build support is provided for <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven 3.3+</a>
and documented for <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle 3.5+</a>.
We recommend developing <i>tapir</i> test cases in <a href="https://eclipse.org/">Eclipse 4.6+</a> with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/">Xtend 2.13</a>.
Details on the installation of the IDE can be found in the following section.
