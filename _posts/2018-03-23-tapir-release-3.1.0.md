We are pleased to announce, that we released Version 3.1.0 of our *tapir* framework today. We focused mainly on some minor bug fixing and some enhancements. Some distinct changes are:
* Assertions are now backed up by *AssertJ*. This enhancement comes with a completely new API for using assertions in your test cases.
* *tapir* supports now the headless modes of Firefox and Chrome.
* Various performance improvements.

You can find the full changelog [here]({{"/docs/changelog/changelog-3.1.0/" | prepend: site.baseurl}}).
