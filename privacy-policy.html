Melsdorf</p> <p>Telephone: +49 4340 4040<br /> Email: patrick.geest@bmiag.de</p> <h2>4. Data
collection on our website</h2> <h3>Cookies</h3> <p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do
not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more userfriendly,
efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by
your browser.</p> <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called &quot;session cookies.&quot; They are
automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them.
These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p> <p>You can
configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case
basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically
accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when
closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p> <p>Cookies which
are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such as
the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has
a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical
errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be
treated separately in this privacy policy.</p> <h3>Server log files</h3> <p>The website provider
automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in
&quot;server log files&quot;. These are:</p> <ul> <li>Browser type and browser version</li> <li>Operating
system used</li> <li>Referrer URL</li> <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li> <li>Time of the
server request</li> <li>IP address</li> </ul> <p>These data will not be combined with data from other
sources.</p> <p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO, which allows the processing of
data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.</p> <h3>Contact form</h3> <p>Should
you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the
contact details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this
information without your permission.</p> <p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the
contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time.
An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request
may still be legally processed.</p> <p>We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you
request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains
(e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions, especially those regarding
mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.</p> <h3>Leaving comments on
this website</h3> <p>If you use the comment function on this site, the time at which you created the
comment and your email address will be stored along with your comment, as well as your username,
unless you are posting anonymously.</p> <p><strong>Storage of the IP address</strong></p> <p>Our
comment function stores the IP addresses of those users who post comments. Since we do not check
comments on our site before they go live, we need this information to be able to pursue action for illegal or
slanderous content.</p> <p><strong>How long comments are stored</strong></p> <p>The comments
and the associated data (e.g. IP address) are stored and remain on our website until the content
commented upon has been completely deleted or the comments are required to be removed for legal
reasons (slander, etc.).</p> <p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p> <p>The comments are stored based
on your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An
informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may
still be legally processed.</p> <h2>5. Social media</h2> <h3>Twitter plugin</h3> <p>Functions of the
Twitter service have been integrated into our website and app. These features are offered by Twitter Inc.,
1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. When you use Twitter and the
&ldquo;Retweet&rdquo; function, the websites you visit are connected to your Twitter account and made
known to other users. In doing so, data will also be transferred to Twitter. We would like to point out that,
as the provider of these pages, we have no knowledge of the content of the data transmitted or how it will
be used by Twitter. For more information on Twitter's privacy policy, please go to <a

Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
View, CA 94043, USA.</p> <p>Google Analytics uses so-called &quot;cookies&quot;. These are text files

information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google
server in the USA and stored there.</p> <p>Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f)

We use &quot;Google reCAPTCHA&quot; (hereinafter &quot;reCAPTCHA&quot;) on our websites. This
service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA
(&quot;Google&quot;).</p> <p>reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website
(such as on a contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this,
reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis
starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA
evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse
movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google.</p>
<p>The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised
that such an analysis is taking place.</p> <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The
website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and
spam.</p> <p>For more information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google's privacy policy, please visit

Google Web Fonts</h3> <p>For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by
Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to
display texts and fonts correctly.</p> <p>When you call up a page of our website that contains a social
plugin, your browser makes a direct connection with Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our
web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a
uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1)
(f) DSGVO.</p> <p>If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your
computer.</p> <p>Further information about handling user data, can be found at <a
