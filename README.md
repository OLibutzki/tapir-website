# tapir website

The tapir website is generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

It's based on the [Jekyll Doc Theme](https://github.com/aksakalli/jekyll-doc-theme).

## Running locally

You need Ruby and gem before starting, then:

```bash
# install bundler
gem install bundler

# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/tapir-test/tapir-website.git
cd tapir-website

# run jekyll with dependencies
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
The last command builds the website and starts a web server at (http://127.0.0.1:4000) which display the site. The server is aware of file changes and automatically rebuilds the website if needed.
